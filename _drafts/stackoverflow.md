I recently became intrigued by how [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) reputation system worked.  Naturally I decided to find ways to grow my own reputation.  After all, with higher reputation you get permissions to do more things on the site.  I thought one way to get more reputation points would be to search for questions about technologies that I am familiar with ([rails_admin](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin), [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise), [sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq), [mongoid](https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid))  and answer them.

I found many questions where people were using these technologies in ways very different than I did.  So instead of easily being able to answer them it challenged me to think about new ways to using these technologies.
