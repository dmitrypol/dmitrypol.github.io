Often you come across a really interesting blog post or YouTube video where someone is showing you a cool new plugin for your framework.  And you think to yourself how it looks so easy to implement and it would really help you.  Or it would be just really cool.  So you start implementing it and surprise, surpise, things do not go as smooth as they did in the demo. 

I wish there was some simple metric we could use to tell us the quality and reliability of new software.  Perhaps it's something like # of lines of code / how long this particular piece of software has been around.
