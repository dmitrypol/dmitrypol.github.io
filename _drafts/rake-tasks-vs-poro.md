When I first started working with Ruby on Rails I liked Rake tasks. To me they were a great step up from ad hoc bash or SQL scripts.  It was a quicky and easy way to build CLI that I could use to do basis sysadmin tasks, generate ad hoc reports, etc.  

namespaced files


But with time I started using PORO classes and just running them via `rails r MyClass.perform`.  The obvious advantages were testing, ability to hit it from controller or job.
