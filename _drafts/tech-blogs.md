I am writing a blog post about other blogs.  Over the years I really enjoyed reading blog posts written by others and learned a great deal from it.  I truly grateful to other developers who spent their time writing up lessons they learned.  

I have learned to be cautious.  I was reading an article recently about how one company implemented a particular Node package.  The author said "we succesfully used it on several large projects" but he put a caveat that for them "large project is 2-3 devs working for a few months".  That is a common situation in small consutling company.  It's exciting to be able to try new things.  Yet problems often surface months or years down the road, long afrer the consulting company developers are done with the project.  

And it's nost just scaling software.  You can simulate lots of load with performance tests to see how your website behaves once traffic increases.  It's about scaling "developer productivity".  How easy will it be to find other developers who know this technology?

Everyone talks about importance of ballance and many people even understand it.  But there is a huge difffernece between understanding and being able to actually do it yourself.  In circus people who watch performer on tight roper understand that he/she must maintain precise ballance and cannot simply lean to left or right.  Yet, how much practice it requires to be able to achieve that ballance?
