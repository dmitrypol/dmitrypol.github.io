I have been writing this blog for a few years and last year also started doing presentation at tech conferences and smaller meetup events.  Here are some lessons that I learned. 

### Articles

I frequently blog about various topics such as Ruby on Rails, MongoDB, Redis and AWS.  I will often combine several topics in one article explaining interesting integration issues.  But my readers may only be familiar with one of those topics.  

Avoid language specific syntax.  Ruby has optional () in method calls.  

The more specific in-depth "better" code I provide the harder it is for beginner to understand.  For example Rails has lots of useful techniques but if I am writing article on Redis it will be harder for my readers who are not Ruby programmers.  Or Redis has advanced features such as `pipelining` but beginner Ruby developers might not know them.  

Lots of comments directly next to code samples.  Do not assume that readers will click the links (especially if they are far above or below) in the article.  

Set expecations from beginning such as "this article assumes certain level of expereince with MVC frameworks"

### Presenations

I frequently take several related articles and create a presentation out of them.  The challenge is that it can cram too much info into a short amount of time.  It may take my read 10-15 minutes to reach one of my posts.  But the presentations I have give are usually 30-60 minutes.  There is only so much new info a human brain can absorb.
