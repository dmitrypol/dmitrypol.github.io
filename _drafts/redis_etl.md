Redis is a very powerful technology but sometimes we still need to structure our data in more relationsal format.  Lots of people know how to write SQL.

There is an interesting gem https://github.com/stripe/mosql that helps you move data from Mongo to PG.

Another option is to ETL data from Redis into SQL DBs.
