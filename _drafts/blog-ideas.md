Where do I get my blog ideas?  I have many years experience building various line of business applications.  They might be not glamorous but it gets the job done.  Software is a tool.  It's about download files, integrating with APIs, sending our reports, etc.  

I like practical solutions.  My articles are usually based on solutions I have implemented at work.  Sometimes I look at a past experience and write about how I would have solved those problems using technologies that I am currently working with.
