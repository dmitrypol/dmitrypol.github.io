Writing this blog certainly takes time.  To come up with good ideas, do appropriate research, have the right code examples.  A single post can easily take hours to write and edit before publishing.  And it certainliy isn't making me rich or famous.  So why do I do that?  

I admit I do like the idea of contributing back to the development community.  After reading and learning from many other blogs, it's nice to give back (or pay forward).  However, I also benefit directly from writing these articles.  

When you explain something to another person it forces you to think about different use cases and areas that you simply did consider when you implemented the solution for immediate needs.  

There is also a big difference between simply discussing something verbally (or reading about it) and actually writing down your ideas.  It forces you to structure them.  That's why before undertaking a big software project it is good to write a technical specification outlining your design.  

This blogs helps me achieve these tasks.  Sometimes I write these posts before designing new features.  Sometimes I do it in parallel with coding.  And often I write these articles after completing the code where I am summarizing my thoughts / lessons learned.  Frequently that leads me to refine my initial approaches and further improve the software.
