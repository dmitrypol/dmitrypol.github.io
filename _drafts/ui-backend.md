I spent most of my career in various individual contributor / team lead roles building software systems.  I love dealing with data, I worry about things like redundant servers, backups and failover scenarios.  But users need UI and they care about it being pretty.  When Bootstrap came out I fell in love with it.  No longer my web pages would have grey background.  I could add nice buttons and tables with a few CSS classes.  Sure, it wasn't a work of art but it was good enough.  But the UX bar kept rising.

Over the last few years I elarned some interesting lessons.  There are several questions you need to ask when building UI.  

Will it be used by only internal users?  In such a case you could go for completely autogenerated UI with tool like RailsAdmin, ActiveAdmin or Administrate (fairly hnew tools maturing fast).  

Regular UI build with traditional tools.  Frameworks like Rails, Django or Symphony allow to generate UIs via command line tools.  You can then customize the HTML, write custom CSS and sprinkle in some JQuery.  

Single Page Applications.  These are the Ferraris of UI development.  They are fast and beautiful.  And also cost a lot.
