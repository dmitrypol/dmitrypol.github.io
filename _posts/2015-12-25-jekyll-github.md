This blog is published using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) so I wanted to share my experience with it.  

#### First the good:
* The price is right.  Thank you GitHub for free hosting.  Yes, you can run a free Wordpress site on [https://wordpress.com/](https://wordpress.com/) but last time I tried it you could not install your own themes or plugins.  
* Do you really the extra overhead of Wordpress (MySQL DB, web server, etc) and 5K plugins (which can slow down your site)?  I just want simple HTML content out there.  
* Scalabilty and reliability.  No platform is 100% reliable but I trust GitHub more than some $5/month Wordpress hosting site.  
* Content back up and revision history are dead simple with **git pull**.  I have a copy of this blog on my laptop and on my home desktop.  With Wordpress I have to backup content in DB separately from the custom these.  
* Ability to move my site.  If tomorrow I do not like GitHub I can easily switch to AWS S3 or another solution.  

#### Now the not so good:
* No WYSIWYG.  Markdown is better than writing raw HTML but still.  
* This a tool for techies. I don't think marketing or sales folks would be comfortable with Liquid templates and git commands.  
* I wish there was a simpler way to install and switch themes (this is where Wordpress is better).
* Since your site is static HTML it limits your ability to integrate things like search or ability for users to login.  
* Wordpress is a powerful CMS which gives you ability to drag and drop widgets around your screen, customizing your pages look & feel.  

But overall I have been really enjoying using Jekyll / GitHub for blogging and plan to continue using it for now.
