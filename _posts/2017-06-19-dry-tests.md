As we add more features to our applications we inevitably have to refactor existing code.  At one point I had to introduce polymorphic relation to a model.  Previously it was simply this with [Mongoid](https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid) and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)

{% highlight ruby %}
class Article
  belongs_to :user
end
class User
  has_many :articles
end
{% endhighlight %}

Now we change it to:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Article
  belongs_to :author, polymorphic: true
end
class User
  has_many :articles, as: :author
end
class Team
  has_many :articles, as: :author
end
{% endhighlight %}

We also need to do a small data migration with [mongoid_rails_migrations](https://github.com/adacosta/mongoid_rails_migrations).

{% highlight ruby %}
class MyMigration < Mongoid::Migration
  def self.up
    Article.all.update_all(author_type: 'User')
    Article.all.rename(user_id: :author_id)
  end
  def self.down
    Article.all.rename(author_id: :user_id)
    Article.all.unset(:author_type)
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Under the hood Rails uses `author_id` and `author_type` fields in `Article` model.  But this post is not about polymorphic relations (read more [here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#polymorphic-associations)).

After implementing this change we need to update `article.user` to `article.author`.  And we need to change [Rspec](http://rspec.info/) tests and [FactoryGirl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl) factories.  

When I was doing this in my application I realized that while I changed a few model / controller (core code) files I had to change LOTS of test files.  I had pretty decent coverage (over 80%) but maintaining the tests became quite time consuming.  The cost of refactoring tests became greater than the cost of refactoring the application.  

The most common reason I had to change my tests is because I was explicitly calling this in my tests:

{% highlight ruby %}
user = create(:user)
article = create(:article, user: user)
{% endhighlight %}

Even though I created association in the factories:

{% highlight ruby %}
FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :user do
    ...
  end
end
FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :article do
    user
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

The reason is I had to test methods on `User` and `Article` that expected specific instances and it was just too easy to create in the test (only one line) than to properly think through how to setup the factory.  And I had numerous validations in my models that required data to be setup in a very specific manner.

One way to avoid this overhead when all we need is to save data to our DB is to do this:

{% highlight ruby %}
it 'some test'
  article = Article.new(title: ..., body: ...)
  article.save(validate: false)
  # test here
end
{% endhighlight %}

Now data is persisted and we can test `article` methods (especially if we don't care about `user` relationships).

A different technique to use [stubs and doubles](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/v/3-6/docs).  

{% highlight ruby %}
it 'some test'
  article = double('article')
  allow(article).to receive(:user).and_return User.new
end
{% endhighlight %}

This is best applied with small modular classes that follow [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle).  

I use these approaches selectively because while I want to test my code in isolation faking too many things can lead to problems of their own.  

Another important lesson to ease the refactoring pain is following [Law of Demeter](http://rails-bestpractices.com/posts/2010/07/24/the-law-of-demeter/) but that's for a different blog post.
